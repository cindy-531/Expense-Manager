I have created a web-based application to manage a user's expenses, called Expense Manager.
The user is able to specify their earnings and categorize their expenses. 
The website then accumulates the user's expenses and earnings by category,
and displays it in an organized fashion on the homepage. 
Another feature is for the user to view a colour coded record of their transaction history 
and search for any individual transaction using the search bar.
